# DataVault_py
The application is built to store stock data for a store or a warehouse. I am not so sure how it works anymore. I created it in 202o, but,
data is scanned for a product and this data is stored in a database or excel document and then it can be accessed vice versa.

first you must connect the DB to run it.
